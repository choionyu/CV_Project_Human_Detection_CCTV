### Human Recognition CCTV Project
### Using the human recognition model HOG based on the support vector machine provided by opencv
### A program was created to send a warning message to the user's cell phone when an intruder crosses the area by designating a specific area in the CCTV video
### Only major functions have been implemented, and in the future, we plan to embed them into CCTV or smart cameras
